### Savings Rate Chaser

Many individuals strive to maximize their savings, but they often find the process of deciding to transfer funds between accounts to be complex and daunting. The challenge lies in streamlining this process and making more convenient to users, for example by aggregating savings rates from various types of bank accounts and ranks them based on the highest interest rates available to customers. Such a tool could even facilitate easy fund transfers, save user details for future transactions, and automatically open new accounts when necessary. How might we design this application to optimally meet the needs of its users?
