## Day 11, 1st August

We met up with our client, to discuss the current state of our prototype.

The client brought up 3 points of improvements to our prototype:

1. To add in a cashback section in the dashboard page
2. A mini popup on our financial summary graph to indicate a switch in banks using our application
3. Confirm our tech stack for the application

Based on his feedback, we have done the following:

- Added a cashback section
