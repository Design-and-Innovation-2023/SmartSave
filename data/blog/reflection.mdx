summary: 'Reflection of our project'

This project has been an incredible journey from start to finish. In the beginning, we faced some uncertainty about the solution's direction, but eventually, we managed to develop a detailed high-fidelity prototype of our concept. Along the way, we were introduced to various new ideas and strategies that played a crucial role in our progress.

One key lesson we learnt was the value of having a **Shared Mental Model** within our team. Embracing our diverse perspectives and developing a common understanding made us work cohesively towards our goals. This process led us to realise that true collaboration meant integrating our individual viewpoints to create a collective vision, making our internal communication smoother.

**Internal and External Feedback** also played a vital role throughout the project. By listening to inputs from within and people outside our team during the daily feedback sessions, we were able to refine our ideas and directions. We began to see feedback as an opportunity for improvement rather than a critique.

The module introduced us to **Integrative Thinking**, which proved invaluable when resolving conflicting ideas within the team. Embracing complexity allowed us to find innovative solutions that incorporated the best aspects of each perspective.

Considering the time pressure we faced over three weeks, we learnt to apply the module's lessons efficiently. This project became a practical application of theoretical principles, emphasizing the importance of rapid iteration and continuous feedback.

Looking back, we are impressed with what we've accomplished in such a short time. Our exceptional teamwork and collaboration, fueled by these insights - shared mental model, feedback, and integrative thinking - were key factors contributing to the success of our project and made everything possible.
