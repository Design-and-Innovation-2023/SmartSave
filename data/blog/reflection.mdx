summary: 'Reflection of our project'
---

This project has been an incredible journey from start to finish. In the beginning, we faced some uncertainty about the solution's direction, but eventually, we managed to develop a detailed high-fidelity prototype of our concept. Along the way, we were introduced to various new ideas and strategies that played a crucial role in our progress.

One key lesson we learnt was the value of having a **Shared Mental Model** within our team. Embracing our diverse perspectives and developing a common understanding made us work cohesively towards our goals. This process led us to realise that true collaboration meant integrating our individual viewpoints to create a collective vision, making our internal communication smoother and setting the tone straight for the rest of the project.

**Internal and External Feedback** also played a vital role throughout the project. By listening to inputs from within and people outside our team during the daily dailies feedback and weekly pitches, we were able to refine our ideas and directions. We began to see feedback as an opportunity for improvement rather than a critique. For example, we took into consideration the feedback on the manual switching of bank accounts that it will decrease the frequency of the action from the users. After internal discussion, we came up with an automated way of transferring money between accounts, which also led to the 2 conflicting ideas which will be illustrated in the Integrative Thinking section.

The module introduced us to **Integrative Thinking**, which proved invaluable when resolving conflicting ideas within the team. Embracing complexity allowed us to find innovative solutions that incorporated the best aspects of each perspective. For example, we had two distinct ideas for the 'account hopping' feature. One suggested an automatic switch of bank accounts, while the other favoured a completely manual approach. Utilising integrative thinking, we reconciled these differing views by introducing an opt-in method for automated money transfers. This solution combined the benefits of both the automatic and manual methods, exemplifying the power of integrative thinking.

Considering the time pressure we faced over three weeks, we learnt to apply the module's lessons efficiently. This project became a practical application of theoretical principles, emphasizing the importance of rapid iteration and continuous feedback.

Looking back, we are impressed with what we've accomplished in such a short time. Our exceptional teamwork and collaboration, fueled by these insights - shared mental model, feedback, and integrative thinking - were key factors contributing to the success of our project and made everything possible.
