summary: 'Reflection of our project'

This project has indeed been a remarkable journey from start to finish. With an initial lack of clarity on what the solution might look like, we eventually came up with a high-fidelity prototype of our concept. Throughout the module, we were introduced to a variety of new ideas and strategies that played an essential role in our progress.

A key theme we discovered was the value of having a Shared Mental Model within our team. As we all brought diverse ideas to the table, developing a shared understanding made it easier for us to work cohesively towards our common goal. This process led us to realise that true collaboration isn't about sacrificing our individual perspectives but incorporating them to form a collective vision. This shared understanding streamlined our internal communications.

The importance of feedback became particularly clear during the project. By incorporating the viewpoints of those outside our immediate team through the dailies feedback, we were able to refine our ideas and directions. This experience helped us to see feedback as an opportunity to improve and evolve, rather than as a critique.

The module also familiarised us with the concept of Integrative Thinking. This strategy proved invaluable when we faced challenges and had to resolve contrasting ideas within our team. Embracing the complexity of holding multiple conflicting thoughts simultaneously allowed us to come up with innovative solutions that incorporated the best parts of each perspective.

In considering wider factors, the time pressure over these three weeks has pushed us to utilise all the lessons from the module efficiently. This project, thus, served as a practical application of theoretical principles within a limited timeframe, teaching us the value of rapid iteration and constant feedback.

Reflecting upon our journey, it's impressive to see what we've accomplished in such a short time span. This would not have been possible without the exceptional teamwork and collaboration fostered by the lessons we've learned. Each of these insights – the importance of shared mental model, feedback and integrative thinking – contributed significantly to our project.
